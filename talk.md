------------------

# From C++11…

- Constant expression functions restrictive

- Executed at compile time

- Only contain a single expression

------------------

# …To C++14

- Relaxes restrictions for constexpr

- Allows variable mutation

- Additional restrictions for static and local_thread variables

- Still executed at compile time

#Novice Friendly

*“I hope that the tide has turned so that C++ is becoming more novice friendly."* – Bjarne Stroustrup

- Less restrictions = more intuitive for beginners

 
------------------
# Personal Opinion

- Beneficial update

- Simplifies update

- Natural combination and flow 

------------------
# Future of C++

- Less error prone

- Easier for beginners to learn

- What do you think?
